## Log format description files for lnav

[http://lnav.org](lnav) is a powerful log file reader, designed to take
multiple log files and order them by date.  It understands log file formats
using regular expresions and can highlight sections of line, find errors
and warnings, and more.

This repository is for the log file format descriptions I've written so far.

You can install these using `lnav -i formatfile.json` or by putting them
in your `~/.lnav/formats/installed` directory.
